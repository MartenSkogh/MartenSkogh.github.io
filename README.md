## Welcome to GitHub Pages

My name is MÃ¥rten. I'm a PhD student employed by AstraZeneca, and a part of the [Rahmlab](https://rahmlab.com/) Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. My research focuses on the use of quantum computers for solving prblems in chemistry and pharma.

My background is in computational physics, but I have a broad set of interests in programming, electronics and science in general. I am also engaged in [Engineers Without Borders Sweden](https://ewb-swe.org), and have been involved for several years.
