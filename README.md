## Welcome to My Page

I am MÃ¥rten, currently a PhD student at the Data Science and Modelling group at AstraZeneca, and at the [Rahmlab](https://rahmlab.com/) at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. My research focuses on the use of quantum computing for solving problems in chemistry, with a current focus on non-Born-Oppenheimer dynamics.

My background is in computational physics, but I have a broad set of interests in programming, electronics and science in general. I am also engaged in [Engineers Without Borders Sweden](https://ewb-swe.org), and have been involved for several years.
